This folder contains exercise that only involves:
0: arithmetic operatos.
1: while()
2: int type
3: function definition.

The number before the file name is the recommended order for 
practicing those questions. When questions are very similar
in difficuly, they share the same order. For example, you
might see 1_exercise1.cc 1_exercise2.cc, it means that the
exercises are pretty much on the same level, so it does not
matter in what order they are practiced.

Note: in several cases a commentted out for-loop solution appears.
