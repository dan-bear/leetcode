These exercises demand:
1: int, char, double types.
2: #define macro
3: for-loop
4: constant size arrays. (no memory allocation).
Note: Exercises might involve auxilery functions and
      arrays might be passed as parameters.

The number before the file name is the recommended order for 
practicing those questions. When questions are very similar
in difficuly they share the same order. For example, you
might see 1_exercise1.cc 1_exercise2.cc, it means that the
exercises are pretty much on the same level, so it does not
matter in what order they are practiced.
